# Capstone Project Idea

I would like to make either a fitness app or fitness website that allows the user to create detailed workout routines in. This app should provide help for doing so by letting the user know what exercises help which parts of their body, possibly provide links and videos related to specific workouts for additional help with form and advice, and give advice on the weight to use depending on the user's goals (bulking, cutting, maintaining, etc.). 

There will also be a section to track what workouts the user has done so far and a section for food and counting calories as a person's diet is the most important part of working out. The user can look up food in the app to find out the calories it contains to help with counting them. If the specific food is not in the database but the user knows the calories that it has, then the user can add it themself. 

For the vidoes I can use youtube and for the workout reccomendations I can use an exercise database such as https://www.fitsw.com/exercise-list/. For the calories of food I can use a database such as https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/.

If I make an app the I would probably use XCode to code in swift for an apple app and if its a website instead then the standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
